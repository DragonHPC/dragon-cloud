You've just deployed a Dragon + Jupyter cluster. In order to access Jupyter Notebook securely, please generate a random access token and write into the "{{ include "dragon.jupyterSecretName" . }}" secret at key "jupyter_token", by running the following command:
    python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(16))" | kubectl create secret generic {{ include "dragon.jupyterSecretName" . }} --from-file=jupyter_token=/dev/stdin
